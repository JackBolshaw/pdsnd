Using SQL on an given database to coax answers from the user to show data relating to a series of questions

# Questions

Q1. Which of the family friendly categories is rented the most?

Q2. Can you provide a table with the all movie titles and divide them into
4 levels based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies
across all categories? And compare this with the spread of each of the family
friendly categories.

Q3. Provide a table with the family-friendly film category,
each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each
combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category.

Q4. Out of the 5 categories in the family friend movies group, which should
the Sakila DVD Rental invest in?

# Conclusion

Although the comedy category in the Family Friendly movie sections is not the most popular choice of movie rental nor is it rented for a longer than average rental duration. Because of the higher prices that movies in the comedy category rent for, the movies in the comedy category have the highest average net profit per movie and should be invested in.
